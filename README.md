## Introduction

The Helical Axis Method is a mathematical technique used to analyze and describe the motion of human joints, particularly rotational movements. By calculating the helical axis, which represents the instantaneous axis of rotation, this method provides valuable insights into joint kinematics.

This repository serves as a collaborative platform for researchers and developers interested in exploring and improving the Helical Axis Method. It contains test data, implementation prototypes, and different approaches to tackle the helical axis problem.
