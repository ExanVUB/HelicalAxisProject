Motion Registration Test Data

This folder contains test data for motion registrations made with various motion registration tools, including the Polhemus Liberty and IMU sensors. The data is intended for trying out different scripts and algorithms for calculating the helical axis.

Contents:

Data files: The folder contains multiple data files, each representing a motion registration trial. Each data file contains the quaternions of two sensors, capturing the orientation of each sensor in 3D space over time.

Usage:

Data format: Each data file follows a specific format, where the quaternions of two sensors are stored in a structured manner. Refer to the file format specifications or documentation for more details on the data format.
